                <p><b>Friedrich August von Hayek</b> (8 May 1899 â€“
                    23
                    March
                    1992), often referred to by his initials F. A. Hayek, was an Austrian-British economist and
                    philosopher
                    best
                    known for his defence of classical liberalism. Hayek shared the 1974 Nobel Memorial Prize in
                    Economic
                    Sciences with Gunnar Myrdal for his "pioneering work in the theory of money and economic
                    fluctuations
                    and
                    [...] penetrating analysis of the interdependence of economic, social and institutional phenomena".
                    His
                    account of how changing prices communicate information that helps individuals co-ordinate their
                    plans is
                    widely regarded as an important achievement in economics, leading to his Nobel Prize.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph">
                <p>Hayek served in World War I during his teenage years and said that this experience in the war and his
                    desire
                    to help avoid the mistakes that had led to the war drew him into economics. At the University of
                    Vienna,
                    he
                    studied economics, eventually receiving his doctoral degrees in law (1921) and in political science
                    (1923).
                    He subsequently lived and worked in Austria, Great Britain, the United States, and Germany; he
                    became a
                    British subject in 1938. Hayek's academic life was mostly spent at the London School of Economics,
                    the
                    University of Chicago, and the University of Freiburg. Although he is widely considered as a leader
                    of
                    the
                    Austrian School of Economics, he also had close connections with the Chicago School of Economics.
                    Hayek
                    was
                    also a major social theorist and political philosopher of the 20th century. His most notable work,
                    The
                    Road
                    to Serfdom, has sold over 2 million copies (as of 2010).</p>
                <p>Hayek was appointed a Companion of Honour in 1984 for "services to the study of economics". He was
                    the
                    first
                    recipient of the Hanns Martin Schleyer Prize in 1984. He also received the Presidential Medal of
                    Freedom
                    in
                    1991 from President George H. W. Bush. In 2011, his article "The Use of Knowledge in Society" was
                    selected
                    as one of the top 20 articles published in The American Economic Review during its first 100 years.
